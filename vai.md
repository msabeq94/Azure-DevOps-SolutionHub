Yes, you can pass pipeline variables from one stage to another in Azure DevOps by using output variables. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Set the variable in one stage**:
   - Use the `##vso[task.setvariable]` logging command to set the variable as an output variable.

2. **Reference the variable in another stage**:
   - Use the `stageDependencies` syntax to access the output variable from the previous stage.

Here’s an example to illustrate this:

### Stage 1: Set the Variable
```yaml
stages:
- stage: Stage1
  jobs:
  - job: Job1
    steps:
    - script: |
        echo "##vso[task.setvariable variable=myVar;isOutput=true]Hello from Stage 1"
      name: SetVar
```

### Stage 2: Use the Variable
```yaml
- stage: Stage2
  dependsOn: Stage1
  variables:
    myVarFromStage1: $[ stageDependencies.Stage1.Job1.outputs['SetVar.myVar'] ]
  jobs:
  - job: Job2
    steps:
    - script: |
        echo "Variable from Stage 1: $(myVarFromStage1)"
```

### Explanation:
1. **Stage 1**:
   - The `script` step sets a variable `myVar` and marks it as an output variable using `isOutput=true`.
   - The `name: SetVar` is used to reference this step later.

2. **Stage 2**:
   - The `dependsOn: Stage1` ensures that Stage 2 runs after Stage 1.
   - The `variables` section uses `stageDependencies` to access the output variable from Stage 1.
   - The `script` step in Job2 then uses the variable `$(myVarFromStage1)`.

This way, you can pass variables between stages in your Azure DevOps pipeline[1](https://devcodef1.com/news/1259691/passing-values-between-azure-devops-stages).
